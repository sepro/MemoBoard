# MemoBoard

Single page web app to keep track of various things, like shopping lists, to dos, ... The backend is written in python
using flask and flask-restful. The front end is coded around the react and redux js libraries. Ideal to run on a hobby webserver 
(e.g. raspberry pi).

# Contribute to Memoboard

Everyone that wishes to contribute to this project is welcome to reach out. Especially developers with JSX and React
experience are invited so scrutinize and improve my code (this was my first project with that technology and there is
room for growth and improvement)

# Acknowledgements

This project makes use of several python packages and javascript libraries, without these development would have been much more complicated.
